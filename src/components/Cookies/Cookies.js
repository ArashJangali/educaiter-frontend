            This Cookie Policy explains how Educaiter ("we", "our", or "us")
            uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website at{" "}
            <a href="https://www.educaiter.com">https://www.educaiter.com</a>{" "}
            (hereinafter referred to as the "Website"). Here, we explain what
            these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights
            to control our use of them.
            <p>
              This Cookie Policy should be read in conjunction with our{" "}
              <a href="educaiter.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you have
              any questions or concerns about the Cookie Policy or its
              implementation, please contact us at contact@educaiter.com, or as

          <h2>1. What are cookies and similar technologies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies. A cookie is a text file containing a string of characters
            that is sent to your device when you visit a website. When you visit
            the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your
            browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information.
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Educaiter) are called
            “first party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website
            owner are called “third party cookies.” Third party cookies enable
            third party features or functionality to be provided on or through a
            website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The
            parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your device
            both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits
            certain other websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local storage. Local storage technologies refer to the methods that
            websites and applications use to store data locally on your device.
            The most commonly used local storage technology is called “local
            Storage” and is part of the HTML5 standard. This technology allows
            websites or applications to store data that persists even after the
            user closes their browser or application, or restarts their device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Session storage. Session storage is a feature of your web browser or
            device that allows a website or application to temporarily store
            data on your device while you are actively using the website or
            application. This data is deleted as soon as you close your browser
            or application, or navigate away from the website. Websites and
            applications may use session storage to improve your experience and
            ensure that certain information is readily available during your
            browsing session.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other tracking technologies. Websites and apps use a variety of
            other tracking technologies too, including web beacons (also known
            as tracking pixels), third-party tracking scripts, advertising
            pixels, and analytics tools. These technologies provide data on how
            visitors use websites and allow websites to serve personalized
            advertisements. We may also use web beacons and “clear GIFs” in
            promotional emails and other communications with you, to allow us to
            count how many people read them and to verify any clicks through to
            links within an email. If you do not wish for the web beacon to be
            downloaded onto your device, you should select to receive emails
            from us in plain text rather than HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as
            “cookies.”
          </p>

          <h2>2. What type of information do cookies collect?</h2>
          <p>
            We, our service providers, and our advertising partners
            automatically log information about an individual’s interactions
            with our Services, such as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Device information, such as computer or mobile device operating
              system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type,
              screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type
              (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including
              identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings,
              mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE,
              5G), and general location information such as city, state, or
              geographic area.
            </li>
            <li>
              Online activity information, such as pages or screens viewed, how
              long individuals spend on a page or screen, the website they
              visited before browsing to our Website, navigation paths between
              pages or screens, information about activity on a page or screen,
              access times and duration of access, and whether individuals open
              our marketing emails or click links within them.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent
            cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you
            delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your
            web browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to remember any
            preferences you have or choices you make when you use our Website.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Why do we use cookies?</h2>
          <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly
              necessary to provide you with our Services. They provide page
              navigation and access to secure areas of the Services. You can set
              your browser to block these cookies, but then some parts of the
              Services will not work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These
              cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of
              Services but are non-essential to their use. However, without
              these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analytics and customization cookies:</strong> These
              cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form
              to help us understand how our Services are being used or how
              effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our
              Services for you. Examples of third-party cookies we use for these
              purposes include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">
                    Google Analytics
                  </a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advertising cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to
              make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform
              functions like preventing the same ad from continuously
              reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for
              advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are
              based on your interests. Examples of third-party cookies we use
              for these purposes include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy">Facebook</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>4. How can you control cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on where you access our Website from, you may be presented
            with a cookie banner or other tool to provide permissions before we
            or our service providers set cookies that are not “Essential.” Where
            this option is available, you may revoke your consent at any time
            with future effect by clicking here or on the cookie settings link
            in the bottom corner of the Website at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Opt out of selling personal information and sharing for targeted
            advertising. We share information with third-party advertising
            partners and allow them to collect information about your visit to
            our Website using cookies as described above. Our disclosure of
            information to these partners may be considered a “sale” or
            “sharing” of personal information or “targeted advertising” under
            applicable laws.
          </p>
          <p>You can also limit online tracking by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Blocking cookies in your browser. Most browsers let you remove or
              reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based
              advertising. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser
              settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change
              your settings. For more information about cookies, including how
              to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage
